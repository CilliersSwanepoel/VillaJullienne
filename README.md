Project Status --

This project was developed pro bono by Cilliers Swanepoel as part of a portfolio and demonstration initiative.

My involvement has now concluded, and the repository remains as-is for demonstration purposes.

Although the client declined to provide formal sign-off, this was not due to the quality or completeness of the work. 
Instead, during the course of the project it emerged that another developer had also been engaged by the client without my knowledge, which led to a conflict of interest.
As a result, no single version was formally chosen, and I stepped away from the engagement in order to close my responsibilities professionally.

All code and documentation remain publicly available here for reference and further use under the repository’s license.
